Building this will only work in Chrome Dev/Canary
The API I need is chrome.precess and it's flagged "Availability: Dev channel"
Not allowed on stable Chrome

Chrome does have shift+esc and dev tools that display all this.

Windows resource monitor shows the max frequency. The max individual thread at the time. So single core usage. 
The current functioning of it shows that it hogs a single core at 100% for 7 seconds. Exactly what I wanted. The
next step is to log it, make a presentation and explain the steps of expanding it. 

The extension works and even changes color based on usage. It shows the effect of the code, and maybe I should add an animation to show glitching in the demonstration.

Next steps:
Expand the CPU hog system more. More time to show V8 protections, expand number of web workers to consume more cores. 

Maybe run this on a VM with a single core.

Comment and clean up the code, it's a little unreadable right now.
